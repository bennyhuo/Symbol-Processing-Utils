# Module Support for Symbol Processors

This is migrated to [symbol-processing-module-support](https://github.com/bennyhuo/symbol-processing-module-support).

If you want to process symbols annotated by some certain annotations from libraries, this library will help you generate some indexes when processing the libraries and load all the indexed symbols when processing the main module.

See [Mixin](https://github.com/bennyhuo/Mixin) to check out how it works.
