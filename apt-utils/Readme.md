# Apt-Utils

This is a util library to help you setup apt project easily. Simply call `AptContext.init(env)` in your `Processor`, and you can access to the `Filer`/`Messager`/`Types`/`Elements` from `AptContext`.

## Print log with `Logger`

I have wrapped the `Messager` into `Logger`, so you can log what ever you want like:

```kotlin
Logger.warn("Hello, %s", name)
Logger.note("This should be visible when compiled with '--debug' in gradle") 
```

## Handle Types

### `ClassType`

When you want to generate both java and kotlin source files, types would be a great mess. So I have introduced `ClassType` as a middle layer, you can use `ClassType::java` for java files and `ClassType::kotlin` for kotlin files.

```kotlin
val STRING = ClassType("java.lang.String") // String
val javaTypeNameOfString: com.squareup.javapoet.TypeName = STRING.java // java.lang.String
val kotlinTypeNameOfString: com.squareup.kotlinpoet.TypeName = STRING.kotlin // kotlin.String
```

### Type Conversion

Conversion extensions are provided to make it easy to convert from `Element` to `TypeMirror` or from `Class` to `TypeMirror` or any other pair of conversions.

### Parameterized Type

I have overloaded the operator `get`, so that a parameterized type may be like:

```kotlin
val ARRAY_LIST = ClassType("java.util.ArrayList") // ArrayList
val STRING = ClassType("java.lang.String") // String
val ARRAY_LIST_STRING = ARRAY_LIST[STIRNG] //  ArrayList<String>
```

### Kotlin Types Mapping

Kotlin maps its primitive types such as `Int`, `Long` and `kotlin.String` to corresponding Java types such as `int`(`Integer`), `long`(`Long`) and `java.lang.String`. AptUtils smart convert this mapping types when you want to generate kotlin files with the `ClassType::kotlin` function.
